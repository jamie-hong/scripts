      "Use the dual objective discussed in class to solve the following maximum entropy optimization problems.\n",

      "Find the the maximum entropy (ME) distribution without any prior distributions (equivalent to uniform priors) with the following constraints:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. with constraints of $\\mathbb{E}[x] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[x^2] = 1$; show that the resulting distribution is indeed normal.\n",
      "2. does your ME distribution from #1 depend on the range of the discrete samples? for example, do the resulting ME distribution look normal if the discrete samples span only [-1.5, 1.5]? explain why.\n",
      "3. define a transformation of $y = e^x$, where $y$ is a lognormal distribution if $x$ is normal. Solve the ME problem using equal spaced samples in $y$ with the constraint $\\mathbb{E}[\\log(y)]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\log^2(y)] = 1$, and check if the resulting $y$ distribution is lognormal (it is not). \n",
      "4. Explain why your step 3 do not result in a lognormal distribution.\n",
      "5. [optional] Can you adjust the prior distribution in #3 to reproduce the similar results as in #1 without changing the equal-spaced sampling in $y$?\n",

      "* this problem illustrate that the importance of the prior distributions.\n",
      "* You can use the me package as part of the class library to solve this problem. You will get extra credit if you can implement your own version of the ME optimizations. If you choose to implement your own, beware that the exp() function may overflow, so you need to apply a cap before calling exp().\n",
      "* for #1. you should try a discretization of a wide range first, for example (-6, 6) with small sampling steps\n",
      "* the Q-Q plot is an effective way to show whether two distributions are similar. Google search Q-Q plot if you don't know what it is."

      "\n",
      "1. try to solve the ME optimization with standard normal as the prior distribution, with the following conflicting skewness constraints of $E[x^3] = -2$ and $E[x^3] = 2$.  Show that the numerical optimizer will fail to find a solution if we don't allow error bounds (ie, like the bid/ask discussed in class); check your implementation so that it fails gracefully (i.e., it should not stop from running the rest of your ipython notebook cells when \"Run All\").\n",
